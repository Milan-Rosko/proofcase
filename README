1 - About
    -----

    “Proofcase” is a collection of some self-contained Rocq developments. Each
    component is designed to stand independently, typically serving as a formal
    companion to a paper, note, or conceptual construction.


2 - Style
    -----

    The formalizations prioritize clarity and minimality. Developments follow
    established practices and contemporary conventions, with an emphasis on
    readable structure and disciplined proof design.

    │
    │      This file.
    │
    ├── _CoqProject
    │
    │      Rocq project manifest. Declares the logical root, namespace
    │      mappings (-Q), and the complete ordered list of source files
    │      to be compiled.
    │
    ├── builders
    │    │
    │    ├── 1 compile.command
    │    │
    │    │      Compiles the project into an isolated shadow build under
    │    │      scratch/shadow/, runs axiom discipline checks, and writes
    │    │      a certificate to success.txt on a clean Makefile run.
    │    │
    │    ├── 2 print.command
    │    │
    │    │      Concatenates selected .v files into a single context dump
    │    │      (v.context.txt). Source selection is driven interactively
    │    │      by a _Textslect file or _CoqProject.
    │    │
    │    ├── 3 tree.command
    │    │
    │    │      Generates a module dependency graph via coqdep. Outputs a
    │    │      .dot graph, edge list, topological sort, and an SVG render
    │    │      into scratch/.
    │    │
    │    ├── _TextslectFLT
    │    │
    │    │      A curated file list for selective concatenation. Read by
    │    │      2 print.command to constrain output to a chosen subset of
    │    │      sources, independent of _CoqProject order.
    │    │
    │    └── success.txt
    │
    │           Build certificate produced by 1 compile.command. Records
    │           the build timestamp, Rocq version, axiom listing, a
    │           _CoqProject snapshot, and optional per-file hashes.
    │
    ├── scratch
    │
    │      Typical “scratch” build folder. Keeps files uncluttered.
    │
    └── theories
         │
         │      Root of all Rocq sources. Organized into numbered theory
         │      subdirectories, each constituting an independent development.
