1 - Description
    -----------

    T001 provides a mechanized proof of the “Carryless Pairing” construction in 
    Rocq. The development relies on the standard libraries Arith, List, Bool,
    and PeanoNat.

    The `artifacts/` directory contains the proof-erasure outputs generated from
    the development.

    │
    │      Concrete realizations and computational examples, including a greedy
